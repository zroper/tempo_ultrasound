//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Process QUE_TTL() runs in the background and sends up to 5 event codes
// per process cycle to the remote system, drawing them from the Event_fifo[] buffer.
// This process should be the last process in your protocol so that any
// preceeding process that adds an event code to the Event_fifo[] will do so
// before QUE_TTL() runs.
// NOTE: Two problems may arise when sending TTLs.  First, TTLs may be sent 
// too quickly for plexon to keep up and plexon may drop them.  This won't
// result in any errors you can see.  Second, too much time may be allotted
// to individual TTLs causing more time to be allotted to TTLs than is possible
// on a process cycle.  This will result in buffer overflow messages in TEMPO.
// The balance between too little time and too much time is struck by 1) the 
// number of micro seconds allotted to each TTL, 2) the number of TTLs sent
// per process cycle, and 3) the amount of other stuff you allow to happen while
// TTLs are being sent.  In rig 028 I have found that 100 microseconds between TTLs
// and 5 TTLs per process cycle results in zero drops and zero overflows AS LONG AS
// I HAVE APPROPRIATELY PLACED nextticks IN AREAS OF HEAVY TTL VOLUME.  That way
// other processes (e.g. rdx communication) don't use up all of the buffer while I am
// trying to strobe.  All of this may depend on plexon settings that I am 
// currently unaware of, and tests should be performed in each rig to find 
// appropriate parameters.
